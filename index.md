Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

ING's commitment to providing employees with constant opportunities for development particularly appeals to me, as I am a curious person. The advertised position as Product / Feature Engineer Business Banking, with its requirements for analytical thinking and communication skills, aligns with my competencies as a Product Owner and offers me the opportunity to broaden my horizons.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong ability to manage a development team, meet expectations from stakeholders, and deliver complex projects that bridge the gap between business needs and technical solutions. I currently work as the product owner of a 10-person team, in which developers, quality engineers, and business analysts from various countries work together remotely on two JAVA microservices. The main task of our products is to validate, aggregate, and provide prices, charges, and levies that are required for billing end customers and energy utilities in the highly regulated German energy market.

My experience in a leading billing software such as powercloud has equipped me with the skills I need for the role of a product / feature engineer. Key highlights of my career include:

- **Product Ownership and Management**: As a product owner, I lead cross-functional teams to develop and \\
  launch solutions that significantly improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
- **Technical Proficiency**: I possess a solid foundation in data analysis and information design, enabling \\
  me to dissect complex questions and generate actionable insights.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: My role requires constant collaboration with stakeholders, ensuring that \\
  technical solutions are aligned with business goals. I excel at translating technical jargon into \\
  comprehensible terms for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Project Management**: I manage projects from conception through to completion, ensuring they are \\
  delivered on time and within budget while meetingall specified requirements.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and certifications align with the needs of ING. With a solid background in software development, complemented by my sharp analytical skills and passion for technology, I am confident that I can contribute effectively to (y)our team and to the future of business banking at ING. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Markus Döring
